# HDDFs 00.07 MPG Dumper

![HDDFs MPG Dumper](assets/screenshot_01.png)

## What is HDDFs
HDDFs is a file system that shipped with some VCR receivers. There's no real documentation
on how it operates which is why I created this little tool. It allows you
to dump your VHS converted videos from the HDD.  
  
## Usage
First create an image from your HDD with a tool like dd.
  
Then extract your MPGs by running  
```
java -jar HDDFsTool-all.jar --input ./hddfs.bin --output ./mpg-out/
```
  
| Params  | Default | Description | Environment Var |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| --input   | | Specifies the input file  | HDDFS_DUMP_IN
| --output  | | Specifies the output directory for the final MPGs  | HDDFS_DUMP_OUT
| --no-mpg-cleanup | false | Cleaning up MPGs means skipping non sequential blocks. Some VCRs simply override deleted MPGs with new ones, resulting in an overlap at the end of the mpg. If you encounter issues with the cleanup you can use this option to disable it.  | HDDFS_DUMP_NO_CLEANUP
| --recover  | false | Dump even deleted data. You might want to use this in combination with --no-mpg-cleanup  | HDDFS_DUMP_RECOVER
| --debug  | false | Dont write to disk, debug output on console  | HDDFS_DUMP_DEBUG
